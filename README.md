# Book Tracker

Book Tracker is a RESTful app that allows Authors to keep track of their books and view the books of other authors. It is build upon Rails Lite ([github](http://github.com/thomasjohnhopkins/RailsLite)), a custom MVC that I created. Rails Lite implements a custom architectural pattern, Agile Record, to give ORM to the framework.
